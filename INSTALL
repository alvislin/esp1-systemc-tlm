  Example Programs for "Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model with OSCI TLM 2.0"
  ===========================================================================


INSTALLATION
============

Installation follows standard GNU tool build procedures. The example programs
should be built in a separate directory. For example if this distribution tree
is in embecosm-eps1-sysc-tlm2.0-examples-2.0, then the following would be
suitable: 

  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../embecosm-eps1-sysc-tlm2.0-examples-2.0/configure
  make
  make check (optional)
  make install (optional)

The resulting programs may be found in the relevant sub-directories of the
sysc-models directory. Suitable OpenRISC program images may be found in the
progs-32 directory of the distribution. They may be optionally rebuilt, but
this requires installation of the OpenRISC GNU tool chain.

Full details are provided in the associated Embecosm Application Note, EAN1:
"Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model with OSCI TLM 2.0", issue 2.
