Example Programs for "Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model with OSCI TLM 2.0"

See the individual INSTALL files in the sysc_models and sysc_models/progs_or32
directories for installation details of their components.

The Or1ksim patch file, embecosm-or32-or1ksim-0.2.0-lib-patch.bz2, should be
applied to a standard patched Or1ksim 0.2.0 source tree as described in the
Appendix to Embecosm Application Note 2.  "Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model
with OSCI TLM 2.0: A Case Study Using an Open Source ISS and Linux 2.6
Kernel".

Example Programs for "Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model with OSCI TLM 2.0"

The Example Programs
====================

To compile all the example models use:

   make all

There are separate targets to compile each individual program:

  make TestSC
  make SimpleSocSC
  make SyncSocSC
  make DecoupSocSC
  make IntrSocSC

Docbook documentation can be compiled with

  make doc

The directory can be cleaned with

  make clean


Test Programs
=============

The subdirectory "progs_or32" contains example programs for use with the
models. See the INSTALL file in that directory for details of those programs.

The IntrSocSC model can also run a Linux kernel. See the Embecosm
Application Note "The OpenCores OpenRISC 1000 Simulator and Tool Chain:
Installation Guide" for details of how to build this.
