Example Programs for "Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model with OSCI TLM 2.0"

The OpenRISC 1000 Test Programs
===============================

To compile all the test programs use:

   make all

There are separate targets to compile each individual program:

  make hello
  make logger_test
  make uart_loop
  make uart_loop_intr

The directory can be cleaned with

  make clean


The OpenRISC 1000 Tool Chain
============================

These programs make use of the (freely available) OpenRISC 1000 toolchain (see
<http://www.opencores.org>). The Embecosm Application Note "The OpenCores
OpenRISC 1000 Simulator and Tool Chain: Installation Guide" gives a set of
instrutions for building this tool chain.
