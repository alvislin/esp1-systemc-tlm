This directory includes some test case programs that should be used to verify correct operation
of the or1ksim, OR32 GCC and OR32 GNU Binutils.

All programs are built and checked by:

./configure --target=or32-uclinux
make all check

You need to have all GNU OR32 tools installed and in the path.

!!! For all test cases, or1ksim should be built with ONLY_VIRTUAL_MACHINE undefined in 
cpu/or1k/except.h !!!

All tests should exit with:
MTSPR(0x1234, deaddead);
syscall exit(0)

If the test fails, it should print as much output as possible about the failure.

dhry: Dhrystone 2.1: a benchmark modified to use simulator's timing facility.
basic: a test for all instructions and all GPRs.
test1: a test for "all" instructions and their combinations.
pic: a test for PIC and TICK timer. All three modes of TICK timer are tested and interrupt is enabled and disabled in PIC.
excpt: a test of l.sys instruction. Checks all the delay slot issues ind other things.
cfg: a test of SPRs (SPR_VR, SPR_CPUCFGR, SPR_DMMUCFGR, SPR_IMMUCFGR, SPR_DCCFGR, SPR_ICCFGR, SPR_DCFGR, SPR_PCCFGR).
dma: a test of DMA in normal (software) mode.
compress: UNIX compressed modified not to use libc calls.
mul: Test l.mul, l.mac and l.macrc instructions.
