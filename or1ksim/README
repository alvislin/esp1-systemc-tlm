	      Or1ksim: The OpenRISC 1000 Architectural Simulator
	      ==================================================


What is this stuff?
===================

This is OpenRISC 1000 architectural simulator. See the file COPYING
for copying permission. To contact the authors, see AUTHORS file.

This simulator loads an assembly file for one of the both architectures
and it simulates the operation of instructions. 


Pre-requisites
==============

The GNU toolchain for OpenRISC 1000 is required. Instructions how to build
these GNU tools can be found on www.opencores.org


Installation
============

The installation uses standard GNU autoconf/automake files. Generic
instructions on this are in the INSTALL file.

Or1ksim is best built in a separate directory.

Both the target architecture and (optionally) the installation directory can
be specified to configure. For example:

  $ mkdir ork1sim_builddir
  $ cd ork1sim_builddir
  $ ./configure --target=or32-uclinux --prefix=<install dir>

Then to build and install run

  $ make all
  $ make install

Note that there is no "make check". To test the simulator follow the
instructions in the "testing" subdirectory.


Simulator test
==============

Follow the instructions in testbench/README to test the simulator.


Help
====

Run sim with --help option for list of command line options and help in
command mode, to list the commands.


OpenRISC and open cores
=======================

This project is licensed under the GNU Public License version 2. See the file
COPYING for details.

About the same idea as with GNU project except we want free and open source IP
(intellectual property) cores. We design open source, synthesizable
cores. OpenRISC is one such core. It is a 32-bit RISC microprocessor that will
run GNU/Linux.  For more information visit us at http://www.opencores.org.
