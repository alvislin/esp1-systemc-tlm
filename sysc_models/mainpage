 *
 *  @section intro_sec About
 *
 *  This is a set of example models to accompany the Embecosm Application Note
 *  "Building a Loosely Timed SoC Model with OSCI TLM 2.0: A Case Study Using
 *  the OpenRISC 1000 Or1ksim ISS".
 *
 *  They are a set of SystemC models encapsulating the OpenCores or1ksim ISS
 *  and building it into a complete SystemC SoC model.
 *
 *  A subdirectory, progs_or32, contains test programs that can be compiled
 *  with the OpenRISC 1000 tool chain for use with these models.
 *
 *  One model (the IntrSocSC model) can also run a Linux kernel. See the
 *  Embecosm Application Note "The OpenCores OpenRISC 1000 Simulator and Tool
 *  Chain: Installation Guide" for details of this kernel.
 *
 *  @section install_sec Installation
 *
 *  See the INSTALL file in the main directory for information on building and
 *  installing these programs
